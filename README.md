# Fire Emblem Heroes Text Simulator

https://ngarces.github.io/FEH-Text-Simulator/

Generates text conversations using assets from Fire Emblem Heroes. Includes background images and text boxes from the game. Portraits can be found from other sources such as [Kaz Kirigiri's FEH Art Collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IzKJZAzSlRL31QkcA7tshBXJdBwsoJBA?usp=sharing) or the [Fire Emblem Heroes Wiki](https://feheroes.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page). For best results, use character portraits that are **1600Ã—1920 pixels**. Also allows for custom backgrounds to be used.

Planning to update this as the game adds more backgrounds.
